<h2> My Work</h2>

<p>I do user experience design from beginning to end, problem to solution, and accessibility is my #1 priority. I analyze problems and find solutions, either with a team or flying solo. I am always striving to improve all my sills, but there are a few that I particularly enjoy. For example...</p>

<div class="skillsflex">
<ul>
 <li><button id="skillbutton1"><h3>Information Architecture</h3></button></li>
<li><button id="skillbutton2"><h3>Usability Testing</h3></button></li>
<li><button id="skillbutton3"><h3>Prototype Development</h3></button></li>
<li><button id="skillbutton4"><h3>Content Writing and Editing</h3></button></li>
</ul>

<p id="IA">Because of the analytical nature, I find building and rebuilding the information archtecture of sites is more than necessary but also a fun activity. I enjoy the categorization process, the analysis and creativity involved, and the focus on the user's mindset and needs. <br> As the backbone of a site, site maps must be done well or the site's usability will fall apart.</p>
<p id="UT">Thorough usability testing is key to creating an accesible, user-centered product. I enjoy the process of presenting a product in-progress to potential users, receiving feed, and iterating the project. The insight of people outside of the design studeio is invaluable.</p>
