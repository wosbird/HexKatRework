<h2>disABILITYsa Responsive Redesign</h2>
  <h3>Project Overview</h3>
  <p>disABILITYsa is a non-profit organization created to serve San Antonio by making it a more accessible and inclusive city. However, the website lacks accessibility and functionality. We found that users struggled to find pertinent information whether looking for resources or finding information on volunteering. By restructuring the site with simplified and meaningful categorization and navigation and applying universal design principles, we will be able to make disABILITYsa.org as accessible, inclusive, and functional site for all potential users.

  <h3>Research</h3>
  <div class="row">
  <div class="col">
    <h4>Competitor Analysis</h4>
    <p>Other non-profits serving similar purposes also suffered 
      from poor web design. </p> <p>╲╱</p>
      <p><b>It became clear that these types of organizations lacked 
        the resources or know-how to build and maintain functional, 
        responsive websites. </b></p>
  </div>
  <div class="col">
    <h4>Proto-Persona</h4>
    <p>The proto-persona was originally going to be newly disabled and 
      looking for resources online. However, that was much more complex 
      than it seemed. </p> <p>╲╱</p>
      <p><b>Revised proto-persona to make her someone who may have been 
        disabled but more importantly was looking for a way to volunteer in 
        the local disability community.</b></p>
  </div>
</div>
  <div class="row">
  <div class="col">
    <h4>User Survey</h4>
    <p>When writing the user survey, I found that I had to adjust 
      my research objectives. Rather than trying to find out how 
      users find resources for disability services, I changed my 
      objective to finding out how users would go about 
      volunteering with a non-profit. 
      Survey was disseminated via Facebook and came back 
      with 19 responses.</p> <p>╲╱</p>
      <p><b>Majority of responders found non-profits to be poorly 
        designed with important information being too hard to 
        find.</b></p>
  </div>
<div class="col">
  <h4>User Interviews</h4>
  <p>The interview questions focused on why and how people 
    volunteer and what they want from an organization’s website.</p> <p id="arrow">╲╱</p>
    <p><b>Interviewees shared that they wanted to see pictures of people, 
      to see who and what they are and do. They wanted to know 
      how they could help and what would be expected of them as 
      volunteers. </b></p>
</div>
</div>
</div>

<div class="container-fluid col-sm-9">
  <h3>User Persona</h3>
  <p>As we refined the user persona, we also refined the scope of this project by making the main user task signing up to volunteer with disABILITYsa. On the 
    current site, it is a confusing process with several different forms that mostly ask the same questions, and each field is 
    required. We simplified the process by making one volunteer page where a user like Tanya could go straight to it from 
    the home page, fill out one simple form, and receive all the information she needs. </p>

<div class="container-fluid col-sm-9" id="infoart">
  <h3>Information Architecture</h3>
  <p>The current site navigation is overwhelming because of the vaguely labeled categories and repetition of page listings. Restructuring the navigation was a key part of this site’s redesign, not only because it’s good practice but also because
    clear navigation is an essential feature in an accessible site. 
    
  I led my team in a card-sorting activity and created the subsequent site map. Information architecture is a particular interest of mine, and I am especially skilled at restructuring websites. </p>
</div>
<div class="container justify-center">
  <img src="../HexKatRework/images/site_map.png">
  </div>


<div class="container col-sm-9" id="wireframe">
  <h3>Wireframes</h3>
  <p>The main driving factor throughout the process was accessibility. We wanted our design to be clean, simple, and easy to navigate; therefore, we used blue as our primary color and green as the single accent color to highlight donations.  Every new feature was tested against web accessibility standards along the way.</p>
  <div class="row">
    <div class="col">
      <img src="../HexKatRework/images/desktopwire.png">
    </div>
    <div class="col">
      <img src="../HexKatRework/images/mobilewire.png">
    </div>
  </div>
    <p>Starting with the wireframes, I incorporated iconography to add to the accessibility of the page. During user testing, many commented on how helpful the visual menu was because a lot of people process images better than text. 
      The layout was purposefully “standard.” We felt that meeting expectations was more important than flashy design. We did, however, stray from the standard when we went with the tiled menu rather than the typical mobile dropdown. 
      </p>
</div>

<div class="container-fluid col-sm-9">
  <h4>Updating the Look</h4>
  <p>Part of the redesign included the logo and color scheme. We didn’t want to change the brand, just update it. We recreated the logo using a new font and used a more saturated blue as the primary color. </p>

    <h3>Hi-Fi Usability Testing</h3><br>
    <h4> Users were able to navigate the site and find the volunteer form </h4>
     <p> Testers offered a lot of positive feedback:<br>

      “I really like how organized it is... I wanted to go straight for donations and membership.“</br>
      
      “The color makes me feel happy.”<br>
      
      “I really like the combination of icons and text in the menu.<br>
      
      “While I was clicking through the menu, I automatically wanted to volunteer.”
      </p>
      <p>
        Testers also made useful suggestions for improvement:<br>
        <ul>
  <li>Add a "home" icon - older users don't tend to know to click on the logo to return to the home page</li>
  <li>Highlight “educate, advance, and engage” in the mission statement - this would help connect the logo with the page itself</li>
  <li>Make the menu icons white on the desktop - I had originally made them black becuase I was concerned about the menu getting too cluttered, but users all agreed that the white icons were better</li>
  </ul>
      </p>

      <h3>Summary</h3>
      <p>Goals Achieved: <br>
        ✔ Meaningful reorganization of information and categories<br>
        ✔ Livelier color scheme & clean, simple design<br>
        ✔ More accessible & user-centered<br>
        ✔ Simplified volunteer sign-up
        </p>

      <p>Obstacles: </br>
        The biggest obstacle we faced was defining the scope of the project. 
        disABILITYsa is a great organization that should have a great site, so we wanted to do as much as possible for them. 
        However, because we only had three weeks to complete the project, we had to choose one to two objectives.
        Additionally, in order to prioritize our objectives, we had to choose the right user. Who visits this site? 
        The obvious answer is someone looking for disability services, but the plethora and spectrum of disability made it challenging to define a user and finding relevant users to interview (especially during a pandemic).
        Because disABILITYsa is an organization that offers volunteer opportunities, we decided that would be the best route to take. 
        By defining the user as someone (disabled or not) who wanted to volunteer with the organization, we were able to find relevant interviewees and narrow the scope of the project to home page, navigation, and volunteer sign-up.
